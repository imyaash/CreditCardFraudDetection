# CreditCardFraudDetection
Developing Credit Card Fraud Detection Model using Machine Learning. I have used a variety of ML algorithms to implement this model and also plotted the respective performance curves for the models.
# The following libraries have been used:
1.  Caret
2.  ranger
3.  data.table
4.  caTools
5.  pROC
6.  rpart
7.  rpart.plot
8.  neuralnet
9.  gbm
# And the following ML algorithms have been used (Accuracu calculated very losely):
1.  Logistic Regression Model
2.  Decission Tree Model (99.95% accuracy)
3.  Artificial Neural Network Model (99.93% accuracy)
4.  Gradiant Boosting Model (95.41% accuracy)
